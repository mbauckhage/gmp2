# Modelling Historical River Landscape Evolution in Virtual Reality (VR)

## Geomatic Master Project 2

The objective of this project is to develop a virtual reality platform that enables users to journey through time and witness the evolution of river landscapes with immersive experiences. A workflow is to be created and implemented, which shows the process to get from a historical topographic map to a 3D modelled landscape in a VR environment. The workflow should be reproducible and allow to be used for different area of interest and with different historic maps.

The following steps will be implemented:

1. Contour lines image segmentation (_01_Segmentation_)
2. ...
